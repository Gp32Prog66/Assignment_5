# Headphones API 

## What is the Headphones API all about?
The Headphones API is the back end section of the headphones project. There is a server file that connects to port 8007 when testing locally. There is a db file that is used to connect to the database through PostgreSQL through Render, and it contains both the online and offline usernames and password information that is commented out. For GitHub, it will default to the online password and username credentials. There are two files in the src file that contains scripts for retriving data from the headphones and earbuds tables. Each contain controller files to retrive from the queries from the queries.js script file that runs SQL commands to PostgreSQL. There is a routes.js script file that the controller file uses to retrive the controller file scripts to run, add, retrieve, and update information to the database. 

## What coding languages were using during the development of the Backend? 
The backend was developed using Javascript and JSON. The library that was used is Node.js for the running the server port. The database that is used to store and host the headphones and earbuds tables and schemas is PostGresQL. Postman is used to retrive, update, and add information locally and online. 


## GitHub Branch Layout
In this Flowchart, thhis goes over how to push information over to the GitHub environment. The headphone database connects to the render server, and it will connect to the local enviroment, which in visual studio, will connect also to the Git repository. The Render server will connect to the latest commit in the repository to host the site. When adding new features, add to the dev branch and do a pull request. Once everything is review and everything checks out, then it will be pushed to the main branch.

## Server Flowchart
When the server is being implemented through Render, it grabs all the data from the PostgreSQL and Web Service environment. The render server will communicate with both Git Repositories for the Web and API section of the headphone project. The host site uses the main branch to deploy the web pages.
